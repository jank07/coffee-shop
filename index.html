                    The best choice is our handmade African coffee.
                    It has an amazing flavour and isn't as bitter
                    as all the coffees. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world and it has a rich history, 
                    especially in Africa. Africa is known to be one of the top coffee-producing continents in the world. 
                    From Ethiopia to Kenya, coffee has been a staple in many African cultures for centuries. In this article, 
                    we will explore the history, culture, and production of coffee in Africa.
